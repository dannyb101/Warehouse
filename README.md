<h1>Command Line Warehouse Inventory System</h1>

This project was completed as part of a university assignment. The brief was to produce an inventory management system for a furniture vendor. It was stated that the vendor sold sofas, beds and tables and that they needed to be able to manage stock levels as well as prices and specific details of every item (color/material etc.). The system also required a user interface for employees.

The management system was achieved using OOP, with a parent Item class (from which specific furniture classes were derived) and a storage class which held items in hashmaps, including methods to retrieve and store items. 

The user interface was achieved at the command line, using switch statements to facilitate navigation around the various menu options.

File reading and writing was also implemented in order to allow for persistance of records across multiple warehouse sessions .
